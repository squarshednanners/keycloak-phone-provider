# Keycloak (Quarkus 20.0.5)  Phone Provider

 + Phone support like e-mail 
 + OTP by phone
 + Login by phone
 + Register with phone
 + Authentication by phone
 + Reset password by phone

sms
voice
phone one key login

With this provider you can **enforce authentication policies based on a verification token sent to users' mobile phones**.
Currently, there are implementations of Twilio and TotalVoice and YunTongXun SMS sender services. That said, is nice to note that more
services can be used with ease thankfully for the adopted modularity and in fact, nothing stop you from implementing a 
sender of TTS calls or WhatsApp messages. 

This is what you can do for now:
  + Check ownership of a phone number (Forms and Rest API)
  + Use SMS as second factor in 2FA method (Browser flow)
  + Login by phone (Browser flow)
  + Reset Password by phone
  + Authentication by phone (Rest API)
  + Authentication everybody by phone, auto create user on Grant(Rest API)
  + Register with phone 
  + Register only phone (username is phone number)
  + Register add user attribute with redirect_uri params

  

## Client:
see my project [KeycloakClient](https://github.com/cooper-lyt/KeycloakClient) ,is android client, nothing stop you from implementing other java program.

## Compatibility

This was initially developed using 20.0.5 version of Quarkus Keycloak as baseline,Wildfily keycloak is not support again, and I did not test another user storage beyond
the default like Kerberos or LDAP. I may try to help you but I cannot guarantee.

### **OTP by Phone**

Two user attributes are going to be used by this provider: _phoneNumberVerified_ (bool) and _phoneNumber_ (str). Many
users can have the same _phoneNumber_, but only one of them is getting _phoneNumberVerified_ = true at the end of a
verification process. This accommodates the use case of pre-paid numbers that get recycled if inactive for too much time.


  in Authentication page, copy the browser flow and replace OTP to  `OTP Over SMS` . Don't forget to bind this flow copy as the de facto browser flow.
  Finally, register the required actions `Update Phone Number` and `Configure OTP over SMS` in the Required Actions tab.

**About the API endpoints:**

You'll get 2 extra endpoints that are useful to do the verification from a custom application.

+ GET /realms/{realmName}/sms/verification-code?phoneNumber=+5534990001234 (To request a number verification. No auth required.)
+ POST /realms/{realmName}/sms/verification-code?phoneNumber=+5534990001234&code=123456 (To verify the process. User must be authenticated.)

You'll get 2 extra endpoints that are useful to do the access token from a custom application.
+ GET /realms/{realmName}/sms/authentication-code?phoneNumber=+5534990001234 (To request a number verification. No auth required.)
+ POST /realms/{realmName}/protocol/openid-connect/token
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  grant_type=password&phone_number=$PHONE_NUMBER&code=$VERIFICATION_CODE&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRECT

  Testing , coming soon!


## Thanks
Some code written is based on existing ones in these two projects: [keycloak-sms-provider](https://github.com/mths0x5f/keycloak-sms-provider)
and [keycloak-phone-authenticator](https://github.com/FX-HAO/keycloak-phone-authenticator). Certainly I would have many problems
coding all those providers blindly. Thank you!
